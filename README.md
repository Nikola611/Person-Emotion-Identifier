# Person-Emotion-Identifier
Project Overview
Welcome to the Person-Emotion-Identifier project! This personal project was created to explore the integration of various APIs and libraries to perform real-time object detection and emotion recognition. The application utilizes advanced machine learning models, computer vision techniques, and emotion recognition algorithms to analyze video streams and images, identify people, and determine their emotions.

Features
The application offers three distinct modes of operation:

Live Video Detection: Utilizes your computer's webcam to perform real-time person detection and emotion recognition.
Upload from Computer: Allows users to upload images from their computer for analysis.
Live Capture: Captures a photo using the webcam and performs person detection and emotion recognition on the captured image.
Technologies Used
1. PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.
The project employs PyTorch to load and utilize the pre-trained Faster R-CNN model for person detection.
2. OpenCV (CV2)
OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
The project uses OpenCV for video capture, image processing, and displaying the results.
3. FER (Facial Emotion Recognition)
FER is a Python library that provides tools for facial emotion recognition.
The project uses FER to detect and classify emotions on detected faces in real-time.
